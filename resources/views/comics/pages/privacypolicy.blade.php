                            <p>When visitors leave comments on the site we collect the data shown in the comments form, and
                                also the visitorâ€™s IP address and browser user agent string to help spam detection.</p>
                            <p>An anonymized string created from your email address (also called a hash) may be provided to
                                the Gravatar service to see if you are using it. The Gravatar service privacy policy is
                                available here: https://automattic.com/privacy/. After approval of your comment, your
                                profile picture is visible to the public in the context of your comment.</p>

                            <p>If you upload images to the website, you should avoid uploading images with embedded location
                                data (EXIF GPS) included. Visitors to the website can download and extract any location data
                                from images on the website.</p>

                            <p>If you leave a comment on our site you may opt-in to saving your name, email address and
                                website in cookies. These are for your convenience so that you do not have to fill in your
                                details again when you leave another comment. These cookies will last for one year.</p>
                            <p>If you visit our login page, we will set a temporary cookie to determine if your browser
                                accepts cookies. This cookie contains no personal data and is discarded when you close your
                                browser.</p>
                            <p>When you log in, we will also set up several cookies to save your login information and your
                                screen display choices. Login cookies last for two days, and screen options cookies last for
                                a year. If you select "Remember Me", your login will persist for two weeks. If you log out
                                of your account, the login cookies will be removed.</p>
                            <p>If you edit or publish an article, an additional cookie will be saved in your browser. This
                                cookie includes no personal data and simply indicates the post ID of the article you just
                                edited. It expires after 1 day.</p>
                            <p>Embedded content from other websites
                                Articles on this site may include embedded content (e.g. videos, images, articles, etc.).
                                Embedded content from other websites behaves in the exact same way as if the visitor has
                                visited the other website.</p>
                            <p>These websites may collect data about you, use cookies, embed additional third-party
                                tracking, and monitor your interaction with that embedded content, including tracking your
                                interaction with the embedded content if you have an account and are logged in to that
                                website.</p>

                            <p>Who we share your data with
                                If you request a password reset, your IP address will be included in the reset email.</p>

                                How long we retain your data</p>
                            <p>If you leave a comment, the comment and its metadata are retained indefinitely. This is so we
                                can recognize and approve any follow-up comments automatically instead of holding them in a
                                moderation queue.</p>

                            <p>For users that register on our website (if any), we also store the personal information they
                                provide in their user profile. All users can see, edit, or delete their personal information
                                at any time (except they cannot change their username). Website administrators can also see
                                and edit that information.</p>
                            <p>What rights you have over your data</p>
                            <p>If you have an account on this site, or have left comments, you can request to receive an
                                exported file of the personal data we hold about you, including any data you have provided
                                to us. You can also request that we erase any personal data we hold about you. This does not
                                include any data we are obliged to keep for administrative, legal, or security purposes.</p>
                            <p>Where we send your data</p>
                            <p>Visitor comments may be checked through an automated spam detection service.</p>
